            <h3>About Me</h3>
        </article>
        <p>
            My name is Widana Arachchige Ayodya Subodi. I was born on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October 2002. I am a Sri Lankan, currently residing in Sri Lanka. Presently, I am taking Advanced Level in my home country. I am studying ICT, French and English Literature. Having learnt ICT for a couple of years, I have developed a keen interest on web designing and without doubt, it is what directed me to take up Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. I am so glad that I  made this decision because I feel that i can cope up with this course as the professor's teaching style really interests me. I also get the feeling that i will excel  at this subject in no time, which always keeps me motivated. I think I have the basic knowledge of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> and I am eager to dive deeper into these and master them.

            Taking light of my personal preferences, I love making new friends, getting along with them and enjoying my life to the fullest. Also, I am a huge fan of music. No matter what mood i am in, music always cheers me up.The song I prefer the most is <em>So Far Away</em> by <em>Martin Garrix</em>. It has a huge impact on me, it is not the lyrics but rather, the music and the melody which makes me mesmerized. I am that type of person who is self-motivated and try to achieve my goals by any means. Hopefully, I will end up my career as a professional web designer, maybe in less than five years. The motivational quote down below keeps me inspired whenever I feel inferior.
